# ${1:LampSolver}
This project was made to help battlefield 4 community to solve the lamp puzzle once its solution changes for each player.
## Installation
No installation needed. Just need java jre installed.
## Usage
First of all you need to follow this guide http://imgur.com/a/JHUQx and get all 7 switches and witch lamps they effect. Its very important
to enumarate the lamps and follow the same enumaration until the end of the process. These numbers are used to solve the puzzle using this
algorithm. Once you collected initial lamp configuration and the 7 switches you may change the file 'input.txt' with your own data.
The first line represents the lamps that are lit at the start of the round.
The second line represents the temple switch and which lamps it effects.
The second line represents the temple switch and which lamps it effects.
